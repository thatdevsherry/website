## السلام عليكم ورحمته الله وبركاته

Hi there 👋🏽, hope you're doing good.

I'm Muhammad Shehriyar Qureshi, a **self-taught Software Engineer** from **Pakistan** with around **4 years** of professional development experience.

I've worked with different languages/frameworks across multiple tech stacks:

- **Frontend:** Angular
- **Backend:** Python/Django, Java/Spring, Rust/Tokio, NestJS (Node)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB

I believe in **skills** and **passion** to best determine a person's capability, not degrees. Grateful to **Allah** for blessing me with **both** passion and skill for this field.

Trying my best to follow the islamic principle of implementing **Ihsan** (excellence) in my work.

I also have a podcast.
