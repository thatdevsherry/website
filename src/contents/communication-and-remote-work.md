The pandemic caused industries outside of **IT** to work remotely. This was a big paradigm shift for most of us. Now that the pandemic is getting under control, we're returning to our normal lives. But the hesitation to "go remote" is creeping back in.

## The reason behind this hesitation

**Communication**, or lack thereof.

Going remote means you now will work **outside** of your physical office. No sitting next to your colleagues. Not getting instant help because you can't just get up and tap their shoulders (or roll your chair to the person you’re about to annoy, not me).

This is how the world has been working for so long, it has become an instinct, comfortable enough that it causes uneasiness when we aren't sitting inside the same building.

Software development was able to adopt "remote-work" earlier (and easier) because it is a collaborative effort. **Special tools** were built to enable **collaboration**, which solved the hindrance of going remote.

## Embracing online tools in office

If the company has at least **one person** who is working remotely, [the team is considered to be remote](https://www.equalexperts.com/blog/remote-first/what-do-we-mean-by-remote-first-working/?utm_id=remote-first-return-4&utm_content=184399985&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-219242136)

Online tools are inherently remote-friendly. They’re on the internet and anyone can access the conversation in or out of office.

These tools can be used as an aid even in office. During physical discussions, meeting notes can be shared in an online tool, which loops in people working remotely.

## Final thoughts

I believe all of us can agree that no matter we work in office or remotely, we use online tools to aid us in our work.

> The step to becoming remote-first isn't figuring the tools out, but starting to over-communicate on the tools already being used.
